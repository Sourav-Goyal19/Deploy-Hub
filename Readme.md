# üöÄ DeployHub

## Overview

DeployHub is a versatile platform designed to simplify the process of deploying and hosting static websites and web applications. Whether you're working with simple HTML/CSS/JS files or complex React/Framer apps, DeployHub has you covered. The platform is built using a modern tech stack and supports robust deployment capabilities with validation features that make hosting your projects seamless.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Effortless Deployment:** Deploy your static or dynamic web applications with just a few clicks.
* **Validation Logic:** Automatically detect and validate whether the project is static (HTML, CSS, JS) or dynamic (React, Next.js) before deploying.
* **User-Friendly UI:** A sleek and intuitive interface for managing your deployments.
* **Scalable Infrastructure:** Built to handle projects of all sizes, from small personal sites to large enterprise applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Infrastructure:** AWS S3, ECS, ECR
* **Orchestration:** Docker
* **Caching:** Redis

## üìê Architecture

DeployHub's architecture is designed for scalability, reliability, and performance. Below is an illustration of the architecture:

### Explanation

* **API Gateway (Express):** Manages requests and routes them to the appropriate services.
* **Database (PostgreSQL):** Stores user data, project configurations, and other essential data.
* **Object Storage (AWS S3):** Stores static assets and deployment files.
* **Container Orchestration (ECS):** Manages Docker containers for deployment environments.

# üöÄ Getting Started with DeployHub

Follow these steps to get started with DeployHub:

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CoderSwarup/Vercel_Clone.git
cd deployhub
```

## 2. Folder Structure

The repository contains the following folders:

* [api-server](api-server): The server handling API requests.
* [build-server](build-server): The server responsible for building and deploying the project.
* [url-reverse-proxy](url-reverse-proxy): The reverse proxy configuration.
* [vercel-clone-frontend](vercel-clone-frontend): The frontend application.

## 3. Environment Variables

For `api-server`
Create a `.env` file in the `api-server` directory with the following content:

```env
AWS_ACCESSKEYID=
AWS_SECRETACCESSKEY=

AWS_CLUSTER_ARN=
AWS_TASK_DEF_ARN=

# Upstash Redis
REDIS_HOST=
REDIS_PORT=
REDIS_PASSWORD=

DATABASE_URL=

# ClickHouse
CLICK_HOUSE_URL=
CLICK_HOUSE_DB=
CLICK_HOUSE_USERNAME=
CLICK_HOUSE_PASSWORD=
```

For `build-server`
Create a `.env` file in the `build-server` directory with the following content:

```env
AWS_ACCESSKEYID=
AWS_SECRETACCESSKEY=

REDIS_HOST=
REDIS_PORT=
REDIS_PASSWORD=
```

For `url-reverse-proxy`
Create a `.env` file in the `url-reverse-proxy` directory with the following content:

```env
OUTPUT_BASE_PATH=
DATABASE_URL=
```

## 4. Test Container Locally

To build the image:

```bash
cd build-server
docker build -t build-server .
```

To test the container locally, run:

```bash
docker run -it -e GIT_REPOSITORY__URL=https://github.com/SafdarJamal/vite-template-react.git \
                -e PROJECT_ID=1 \
                -e DEPLOYEMENT_ID=<DEPLOYMENTID> \
                -e AWS_ACCESSKEYID=<YOURKEY> \
                -e AWS_SECRETACCESSKEY=<YOURKEY> builder-server
```

### üåê Deployment

DeployHub can be deployed on any cloud platform. Here‚Äôs an example setup using AWS:

* **Set Up S3 Buckets:** For storing static assets.
* **Deploy Docker Containers:** Use ECS to manage your Docker containers.
* **Configure Load Balancer:** Set up an AWS ELB to distribute traffic across your containers.
* **Set Up Aiven Services:** Utilize Aiven for managed PostgreSQL and ClickHouse services.

### üõ°Ô∏è Security

DeployHub prioritizes security with the following measures:

* **Authentication:** All sensitive operations require authentication and are protected by JWT.
* **Encryption:** Data at rest and in transit is encrypted using industry-standard techniques.
* **Access Control:** Role-based access control ensures that only authorized users can perform critical operations.
